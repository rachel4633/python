## Test 1
# By use of a function that accepts parameters, calculate the simple interest given principal as 45000, rate is 7% and the time taken is 8 years. (si = p*r*t/100)
# Use the same function inside of a loop to calculate two other simple interests. Note use your own principal, rate and time.


def simpleinterest(x,y,z):
    interest = (x * y *z)/100
    print("The simpleinterest is.", interest)

simpleinterest(45000,7,8/100)
