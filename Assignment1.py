# 1.Write a python program that is able to calculate the BMI of a person whose weight is 78kgs and height is 1.75metres.BMI=(weight)/(height squared)

weight = 78
heightsquared = 1.75
BMI = (weight)/(heightsquared)**2
print("The BMI is: ", BMI)

# 2.Find the Area and Perimeter of a rectangle whose length is 48cm and width is 25cm.

#Area
width = 25
length = 48
Area = (length * width)
print("The Area is: ", Area)

#Perimeter
width = 25
lenght = 48
Perimeter =((length+width)*2)
print("The Perimeter is: ", Perimeter)
