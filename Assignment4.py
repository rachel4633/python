 #  A function = is ablock of reusable code
#                place () after the function name to invoke it
# we use the data type (def)
# t0 invoke a function you type the function in  and add set of parenthisis
# you can put a name inn the fucntion that will be an argument per funtion and a parameter 
# addition of parameter does matter

#return= is a statemnt ised to end a function
#        and send a result back to the caller


# A function without a parameter is used when task is static meaning it does the exact same htong every time it is called
# We use it when printing a standard header clearing a screen or getting system time

# Function with parameter is used when you want the function to be dynamic you provide placeholders (parameters) in the definition you pass actual values
#used when the results of a function depends on external data like calculating a sum formatting a specific name, or processing a file.
